# Todo

- leveling system
    - leaderboard
    - migrate levels from Mee6
    - customisable level background
- warns
- mutes
- custom announce stuff
    - Generate auth code (maybe generate it when they are added to the database, and show it to them through a command)
    - List snipes
    - Before this can happen, announce system has to be migrated to new database
	- Create a script to migrate from MongoDB -> PostgreSQL
- snipe related commands
    - next command (includes namemc searches and / or length of name)
    - snipes
        - show past snipes for a user
    - minecraft account info
- music commands
- automod
    - regex for nono words and stuff
    - find a large wordlist of words that should be blacklisted and add those too
- tags
    - delay
    - load tags from json file, possibly. This allows for easy creation.
