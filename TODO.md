# Todo

- leveling system
    - levels measured in minutes
    - message at every 100 minutes
    - leaderboard
    - migrate levels from Mee6
    - Before this can happen, we need a database system.
- warns
    - need db first
- mutes
    - again, need db first.
- custom announce stuff
    - Generate auth code
    - List snipes
    - Before this can happen, announce system has to be migrated to new database (postgresql or sqllite; I'm leaning towards postgresql)
